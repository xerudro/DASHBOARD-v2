# VIP Hosting Panel v2 - Stability & Error Handling Analysis

## Executive Summary
Found 15 Critical, 18 High, 9 Medium issues affecting stability, error handling, and reliability.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Job Enqueueing Missing (BLOCKS FEATURE)
**File:** internal/handlers/server.go lines 200, 337
- TODO: Enqueue provisioning job (line 200)
- TODO: Enqueue server destruction job (line 337)
- Impact: Servers created but NEVER provisioned!

### 2. Goroutine Leaks
**Files:** 
- internal/audit/logger.go (no Close() method)
- internal/database/pool_optimizer.go (no Stop() method)
- Impact: Memory leaks, resource exhaustion on shutdown

### 3. Background Goroutine Crashes
**Files:** Multiple goroutines lack panic recovery
- internal/audit/logger.go lines 81-84
- internal/database/pool_optimizer.go lines 59-62
- Impact: Single panic crashes entire application

### 4. Unhandled Errors in Async Operations
**File:** cmd/worker/main.go lines 150-153
- Server Fatal in goroutine doesn't exit main
- Impact: Worker continues despite failed server

### 5. No Idempotency for Jobs
**File:** internal/jobs/server_provisioning.go
- Asynq retries (maxRetry=3) cause duplicates
- No request deduplication
- Impact: Duplicate server creation

### 6. Race Conditions
**Files:**
- internal/audit/logger.go lines 226-232 (buffer length check)
- internal/database/pool_optimizer.go (metrics access)
- Impact: Data corruption

### 7. Cache Invalidation Failures
**File:** internal/services/providers/hetzner.go
- Cache operation errors ignored
- Impact: Stale data served to clients

### 8. Type Assertion Panics
**File:** internal/middleware/jwt.go lines 92, 124
- No guards on c.Locals() type assertions
- Impact: Panic if JWT context missing

### 9. Status Updates Ignored
**File:** internal/jobs/server_provisioning.go line 116-119
- updateServerStatus errors not propagated
- Job continues with inconsistent state

### 10. Missing Job Validation
**File:** internal/jobs/server_provisioning.go
- No validation of payload fields
- Missing ServerID, TenantID, Provider checks
- Impact: Invalid provisioning requests

### 11. No Graceful Shutdown
**File:** cmd/api/main.go lines 420-429
- Missing cleanup for:
  - PoolOptimizer goroutines
  - AuditLogger goroutines
  - Monitoring cleanup
  - Cache closure
- Impact: Resource leaks on every shutdown

### 12. Context Misuse in Handlers
**Issue:** Creating new contexts from Background()
- Loses request cancellation
- Wastes resources on abandoned work
- Fix: Use request context

### 13. No Circuit Breaker
**File:** internal/services/providers/hetzner.go
- Direct API calls with no protection
- Single failure cascades
- Impact: All provisioning fails on API outage

### 14. Missing Health Checks
**File:** cmd/api/main.go health endpoint
- Missing: Redis, Hetzner API, goroutine count, memory
- Impact: Cannot detect degraded state

### 15. No Retry Logic
**File:** internal/handlers/server.go
- Database queries fail immediately on transient errors
- No exponential backoff
- Impact: Unnecessary failures

## High Priority Issues (Must Fix Soon)

### Cache Timeout Conflicts
- File: internal/cache/redis_cache.go line 54
- New timeout context overrides request timeout

### Connection Pool Exhaustion
- Max connections = 25 (too low)
- No queue when exhausted
- Requests fail immediately

### Missing Request ID Propagation
- Generated but not used for tracing
- Impossible to correlate request through components

### Inconsistent Error Handling
- Some errors logged and ignored
- Some errors propagate
- No consistent policy

### Race in Metrics
- Unprotected field access in pool_optimizer.go
- Concurrent read/write without sync

### Silent Cache Failures
- SAdd/Expire errors ignored (redis_cache.go line 119-126)

### Incomplete Shutdown
- Audit logger Close() doesn't exist
- PoolOptimizer Stop() doesn't exist

### Missing Observability
- No job execution metrics
- No failure analysis data
- No slow job detection

## Severity Scorecard
- Critical: 15 issues
- High: 18 issues  
- Medium: 9 issues
- Total: 42 stability/reliability issues

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. IMMEDIATE: Fix TODO items (job enqueueing) - feature blocking
2. IMMEDIATE: Add Close/Stop methods for goroutines
3. HIGH: Add panic recovery to background goroutines
4. HIGH: Fix type assertion guards
5. HIGH: Implement idempotency for jobs
6. HIGH: Add circuit breaker for Hetzner
7. HIGH: Fix race conditions
8. HIGH: Implement job validation

## Production Assessment
**Status: NOT READY**
- Feature incomplete (job enqueueing)
- Data loss risks (goroutine leaks)
- Data corruption risks (races)
- Duplicate data risks (no idempotency)

Recommend addressing all 15 critical issues before production.
